Since Gosset was working at Guinness around that period, he had to publish his work under psudonym "Student". 
Later Ronald Fisher (another big name in statistics) collaborated with Gosset.
He uses the last letter of the pseudonym, "t" to denote the name of the statistics and the distribution. 
This is the origin of the name *t-distribution*.

The shape of the t-distribution is determined by the degrees of freedom, which is proportional to the number of observations (here in particular = the number of observations - 1).


## Try

* Use the "x" slider to highlight the area.
   * What is the total area under the curve?
* Try changing the degrees of freedom.
   * When does the t-distribution seem to behave like the Normal distribution?
