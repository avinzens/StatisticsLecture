Back in 1907, William Sealy Gosset discovered a probability distribution function that captures the behavior of small sample size well.
He wanted to provide an evidence for this function with a real data.
However, back in days, there were no computer simulation.
Therefore, he simluated this by manually drawing 750 random samples from a table containing height measurements of 3,000 people.
To appreciate this work, you should check out [pages of his notebook](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/Student/750samplesOf4/).
Fortunately, we can have the computer do that for us.

For each sample Gosset calculated a statistic: $(\bar{x} - \mu)/SD$, where 

* $\bar{x}$ is the mean of each sample
* $\mu$ is the mean of the population (3000 people), and 
* $SD$ is the SD of each sample.

In plain words, it is the difference between the mean of each sample and the population mean, scaled by the SD of each sample.
(You don't have to remember this formula.)


In the plot below, the grey histogram show the samples. However, we normalized the histogram such that the total area below the histogram bar is equal to 1.
Thus, this histogram shows the probability density instead of the frequency.

The <span style="color:blue">blue line</span> overlaid on the histogram is the distribution that Gosset propose. 
The <span style="color:red">red line</span> is the normal distribution, which doesn't change according the number of samples or the number of observations.
The area under each curve is the probability when we sample from the population.

## Try

* Adjust the number of sample and the number of observation and observe the shape of the distribution
   * Which parameter changes the shape of the distribution?
* Adjust the number of sample to very low (e.g., 2). Which line behaves more similar to the histogram?
