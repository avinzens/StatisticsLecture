In research studies, we *sample* the *population*. Each sample comprises multiple *observations*. From each sample, we can calculate its mean and its SD. The behavior of these means an SDs (of many many samples) behaves in a curios way.

## Observe
The population is shown on the top-most plot, and the population histogram and mean is shown in the second plot.

For this simulation, you can modify the population by clicking on the graph like before.
