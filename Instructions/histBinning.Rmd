A histogram shows how a dataset is distributed. The data is groupped into bins, and the frequency of data in each bin is represented by the height of each bar.

## Experiment

Try changing the bin width and notice the following changes:

* The range of the vertical axis
* The height of the tallest bar
* The width of each bar

Try changing the number of data rows and notice the following changes (or the lack thereof):

* The number of rows in the table
* The range of the vertical axis of the histogram
* The height of the tallest bar of the histogram
* The overall shape of the histogram

Try small number of rows (e.g., 5) and change the bin width. Notice how fast the shape changes. Repeat with the large number of rows.

## Questions

What are things to consider when you inspect a dataset?
