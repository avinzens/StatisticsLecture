* **Ordinal scales:** Has a natural *order*, but the difference between each level does not have any arithmatical meaning.
* **Interval scales:** Values are organized as a sequence of equal intervals, but the "zero" is assigned at arbitrary point.
* **Ratio scales:** These are interval scales with a meaningful zero point (= total absence).
