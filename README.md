2. Test R Markdown
   * Open the project file `Statistics lecture.Rproj` in Rstudio
   * In RStudio, you will find the `files` panel, which is usually at the bottom right corner. Select `statistics1.R` to open the file in the editor.
   * In the editor, click `Run Document` in the toolbar.
   * During the first run, RStudio will ask you to install required packages such as `knitr`. Please install them.
   * After the installation is completed, RStudio will execute the code and show you the output on your browser. You should expect to see the screen like the image below.
   * Changing the sliders should change the data in the table
