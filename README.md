#Statistics for HCI
This repository contains the materials accompanying statistics lecture.

#Preparation
1. Install the following software
   1.1 [R 3.3.1](https://www.r-project.org/)
   1.2 [RStudio v1.0.15 Preview](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) We will use the R Notebook feature for the exercises in-class.

2. Test R Markdown
   2.1 Open the project file `Statistics lecture.Rproj` in Rstudio
   2.2 In RStudio, you will find the `files` panel, which is usually at the bottom right corner. Select `Test.Rmd` to open the file in the editor.
   2.3 In the editor, click `Run Document` in the toolbar.
   2.4 During the first run, RStudio will ask you to install required packages such as `knitr`. Please install them.
   2.5 After the installation is completed, RStudio will execute the code and show you the output on a separate window. You should expect to see:
      * a data table
      * two sliders
      * a graph
   2.6 Changing the sliders should change the line in the graph
