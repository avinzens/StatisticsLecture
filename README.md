#Statistics for HCI
This repository contains the materials accompanying statistics lecture.

#Preparation
1. Install the following software
   * [R 3.3.2](https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/)
   * [RStudio v1.0.44 or newer](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/)

2. Test R Markdown
   * Open the project file `Statistics lecture.Rproj` in Rstudio
   * In RStudio, you will find the `files` panel, which is usually at the bottom right corner. Select `Test.Rmd` to open the file in the editor.
   * In the editor, click `Run Document` in the toolbar.
   * During the first run, RStudio will ask you to install required packages such as `knitr`. Please install them.
   * After the installation is completed, RStudio will execute the code and show you the output on a separate window. You should expect to see:
      - a data table
      - two sliders
      - a graph
   * Changing the sliders should change the line in the graph

   * Open the `TestNotebook.Rmd`
